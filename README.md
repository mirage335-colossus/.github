Exceptional scale and versatility has been reached by some projects to the point of becoming sources of, or outright, significant software products. Such software products arguably more befit the treatment afforded to at least a sole-proprietorship LLC style organization. GitHub seems to nudge the creation of formal 'organizations' as such. In particular, GitHub hosted 'GitHub Actions' larger runners are only available to organizations, and rapid CI cycle times have become necessary for responsible software development. 

Naming of 'colossus' with the motto 'optimal is predictable' refers to the unique ability of such scale and versatility to work both from inside (eg. as bash shell enhancement, shell script structure, bash shell for Cygwin/MSW), from outside (eg. by calling: '_openChRoot', '_chroot', '_userVBox'), as well as both simultaneously (eg. by ' ubiquitous_bash.sh ' copying itself to "$globalVirtFS"/ and then itself calling itself through '_chroot ubiquitous_bash.sh' .

Such software projects as are here have become very powerful, relied upon much more than many times per day.
